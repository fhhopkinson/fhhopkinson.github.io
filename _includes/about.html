                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A desire for a change in direction in my life led me to take General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course in order that I could work in web development. 
                </p>
                <p>I had previously been an Army officer and subsequently I ran a gold mine before having a life changing accident which made me take a long hard look at my life and I realised that I was not making the most of it hence the pursuit of this new career.</p>
